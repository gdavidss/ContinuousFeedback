The Continuous Feedback app is a unique and engaging way to give feedback to other humans. With our app, you can simply pan the screen to adjust the background color and hear a ticking sound that changes rate as you pan. The color and sound are determined by the scroll position of the scroll view, with red and green values changing based on the scroll offset. A label is also displayed with the percentage value of the color. You can tap the label to invert it and change sides. The pan gesture and scroll view delegate are implemented to handle the user's input and update the background color and sound accordingly.
