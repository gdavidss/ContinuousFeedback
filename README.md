This code is for a continuous feedback app where the user can pan the screen to adjust the background color. The color is determined by the scroll position of the scroll view, with red and green values changing based on the scroll offset. A label is also displayed with the percentage value of the color. The pan gesture and scroll view delegate are implemented to handle the user's input and update the background color accordingly.
